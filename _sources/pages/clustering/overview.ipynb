The classification of projectile points is an important topic in anthropology. The classes are based on shape distinctions such as the presence and location of a notch in the arrow. The problem in the repository is a length normalised version of that used in Ye09shapelets. The three classes are called “Avonlea”, “Clovis” and “Mix”.”\n",
